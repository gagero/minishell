* Notes
** Don't forget to turn off the sanitizers (-fsanitize=address,leak,undefined in Makefile) when using valgrind
** I tried to restructure the code into separate src/ obj/ and include/ folders but I didn't manage to get the Makefile to work

* Failing testcases
	| |
	no prompts (I forgot about them)
need to test quotes
