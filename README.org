* Notes
** Don't forget to turn off the sanitizers (-fsanitize=address,leak,undefined in Makefile) when using valgrind
** I tried to restructure the code into separate src/ obj/ and include/ folders but I didn't manage to get the Makefile to work
* Failing testcases
  * pipe first command outputs then hangs
  * need to test quotes (unmatched quotes, nested quotes, envvar expansion in quotes)
  * Redirections don't seem to do anything
  * C-\ twice in a row fucks up prompt
  * interactive commands (nano) fuck up prompt
  * Command not found doesn't work
