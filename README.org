* Notes
** Don't forget to turn off the sanitizers (-fsanitize=address,leak,undefined in Makefile) when using valgrind
* Failing testcases
  * pipe first command outputs then hangs
  * Redirections don't seem to do anything
  * need to test quotes (unmatched quotes, nested quotes, envvar expansion in quotes)
  * Triple pipes don't work
    * Single pipes segfault occasionally
