* Notes
** Don't forget to turn off the sanitizers (-fsanitize=address,leak,undefined in Makefile) when using valgrind
** I tried to restructure the code into separate src/ obj/ and include/ folders but I didn't manage to get the Makefile to work
* Failing testcases
  * we don't wait for output before reprinting prompt, breaks ls (wait_en_masse() breaks?)
  * signals don't get passed to binary
  * pipe first command outputs then hangs
  * need to test quotes (unmatched quotes, nested quotes, envvar expansion in quotes)
  * Redirections don't seem to do anything
  * SIGQUIT fucks up cursor
  * Pipes run first command again
  * Exit doesn't work
